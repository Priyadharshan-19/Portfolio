👩‍💻 Priyadharshan M | AI-Powered Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my expertise in Generative AI, IoT Edge Computing, and Full-Stack Development.

A standout feature of this portfolio is the integration of a context-aware AI Assistant that makes my projects, skills, and experience instantly searchable — acting as an interactive résumé.

✨ Key Features
✅ Interactive AI Assistant (Core Feature)

A floating, custom-built chat widget powered by the Google Gemini API, trained on:
My resume data
Project descriptions
Technical focus areas
It works as an interactive résumé inside the website.

✅ Modern Architecture
Built as a high-performance Next.js Single Page Application (SPA) with optimized routing.

✅ Fully Responsive
Designed to look clean and consistent across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

✅ Smooth User Experience
Uses Framer Motion for clean animations and transitions throughout the interface.
